  <h1>Discover Liverpool</h1>

<div class="page-container">
  <p>
    Liverpool is a vibrant port city in northwest England, famous for its music,
    football, and waterfront. The city grew around the River Mersey and was once
    one of the world’s busiest harbours. Today visitors stroll along the Royal
    Albert Dock, where warehouses now hold museums, shops, and restaurants.
    Liverpool is also the birthplace of The Beatles, and music fans can explore
    venues where the band first performed. Sports lovers know the city for
    Liverpool FC and Anfield’s electric match-day atmosphere. Beyond the big
    attractions, Liverpool offers friendly neighbourhoods, street art, and a
    lively nightlife scene. Historic buildings sit beside modern architecture,
    giving the skyline a unique mix of old and new. Whether you enjoy culture,
    sport, or simply walking by the water, Liverpool is an exciting place to
    discover.
